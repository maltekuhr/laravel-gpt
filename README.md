Introducing LaravelGpt, a tool designed to simplify the integration of OpenAI's ChatGpt with your Laravel applications. This package offers a seamless connection to the OpenAI Chat Completions API, even supporting Function Calling. Forget the complications of crafting the correct JSON schema - LaravelGpt does the work for you. Say goodbye to dense, hard-to-read code, and start building the applications of the future! With LaravelGpt, you can truly unleash the power of ChatGpt in your applications, setting the stage for innovation and advanced user interaction.

## Installation
You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require maltekuhr/laravel-gpt

Next you need to configure your OpenAI API Key and Organization ID. You can find both in the [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings).

```dotenv
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

You are now ready to use LaravelGpt! I recommend you to read the [Documentation](https://laravel-gpt.com).
